The main cpp file has a lot of boilerplate code provided by the professor(Mike Bailey) to get students up and running and to be able to focus on shaders, which was what the class was about. The code for loading in the sphere was provided by the class as well (OSUsphere), it had great vertex and normal data. The vertex and fragment shader were all programmed by me. I have per-fragment lighting and calculated the thickness of the sphere along the vector from the fragment to the light source and used the resulting thicknes to calculate the subsurface scattering for that fragment.
